## Getting Started

Be sure you've read the [instructions for contributing to the LOS repository](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/learning-os-software/blob/master/appendix/how-to-modify.md). These apply here, too, except that you will substitute `idm` for `learning-os-software`.

1. **Globally** install [nvm][nvm], [avn][avn], and [avn-nvm][avn-nvm], insofar as they are not already installed.

- If `nvm --version` does not return a version, install [nvm][nvm] with:

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
- If `which avn` does not return a path and version, install [avn][avn] with:

    ```bash
    npm install -g avn avn-nvm
    avn setup
    ```

2. Create an [npm][npm] account if you don't have one, then setup your `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`:

    ```bash
    npm login
    # in your current shell as well as in ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc, etc)
    export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=$(cat $HOME/.npmrc | grep _authToken | cut -d '=' -f2)
    ```

3. Fork this [IDM repository](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/idm) and clone your fork.

4. Inspect the .nvmrc file in your cloned directory. It specifies the version of node that is compatible with this package. Check your installed versions of node (`nvm ls`) to see whether the compatible version is one of them. If not, install it (e.g., `nvm install 6.11.1`). Then begin using it (e.g., `nvm use 6.11.1`). By doing this now, you are causing the next package to be installed under that version, which is where you need it for use with IDM.

5. Setup and run [mehserve][mehserve]. This includes entering the 5 `sudo` commands appearing in the output from `mehserve install`. Then figure out which port you intend to use and create the mehserve config file:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.mehserve
    echo 9001 > ~/.mehserve/idm.learnersguild
    mehserve run
    ```

6. Open another terminal window for the subsequent commands. Set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable. Warning: This setting is not persistent. If you open yet another terminal window for any subsequent commands, repeat this command there before entering other commands.

    ```bash
    export NODE_ENV=development
    ```

7. [Install RethinkDB][install-rethinkdb].

    ```bash
    # With Homebrew on a mac:
    brew update
    brew install rethinkdb
    ```

8. Install [Redis][redis].

    ```bash
    brew install redis
    ```

9. Obtain your GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (see below) by registering a new [GitHub OAuth application][github-register-application] for _your_ development environment:
    - Application name: Learners Guild IDM (dev)
    - Homepage URL: http://idm.learnersguild.dev
    - Authorization callback URL: http://idm.learnersguild.dev/auth/github/callback

10. Generate a key-pair for JWT token signing / verifying. If you have a `~/.rnd` file and you have no write permission on it, you can delete it as shown and it will be regenerated by the `genrsa` command. If you have no `~/.rnd` file or you have one that you have write permission on, you can omit the `rm` command.

    ```bash
    sudo rm ~/.rnd
    openssl genrsa -out /tmp/private-key.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in /tmp/private-key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out /tmp/public-key.pem
    ```

11. If you do not already have one, create a free AWS account: [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/). In that account, create an IAM user to represent your IDM development environment. Give that user programmatic access to read and write S3 buckets. Make a copy of that user's access key ID and secret access key. You'll need to include these in your environment variables in the next step.

12. Create the `.env.development` file for your environment and save it in your IDM project directory. Use the following template, replacing placeholders in angle brackets (<>) with their actual values.

    ```bash
    PORT=9001
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
    RETHINKDB_URL=rethinkdb://localhost:28015/idm_development
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<from above>
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<from above>
    # Both of the URLs below are needed and remove this commented line
    APP_BASE_URL=http://idm.learnersguild.dev
    IDM_BASE_URL=http://idm.learnersguild.dev
    # For JWT string data below, replace all linebreaks with \n
    # and include -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    # remove these three commented lines
    JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="<quoted string data from /tmp/private-key.pem >"
    JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="<quoted string data from /tmp/public-key.pem replace all linebreaks with \n >"
    S3_BUCKET=guild-development
    S3_KEY_PREFIX=db
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    ```

13. Run RethinkDB:

    ```bash
    brew services run rethinkdb
    ```
    
14. Run the setup tasks. The installation command will take about a minute and generate about 200 warnings about the replacement of bundled versions. This is normal.

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run db:create
    npm run db:migrate -- up
    ```

15. Seed your development database with test member and project data:

    ```bash
    npm run db:copy
    ```

16. Run the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

17. In your browser, visit the server at:

    ```bash
    http://idm.learnersguild.dev
    ```

## Gotchas (i.e. Troubleshooting)

### AVN is not working

When you `cd` into your IDM project directory, you should see a line like `avn activated 6.11.1 via .nvmrc (avn-nvm v6.11.1)`, showing that avn has switched your node version to the one specified in your `.nvmrc` file.

If you don't see that line, perhaps your nvm is not linked. Try entering  
`cp $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh ~/.nvm/`

If your shell is bash, you might have a logged-in shell. If so, you'll need to add the following code to your `~/.bash_profile` instead of your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, because those don't always load. (To test for sure, add an `echo testing` command at the top of your RC files. If you see nothing when opening new terminal tabs, you're using the bash logged-in shell.)

```sh
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[[ -s "$HOME/.avn/bin/avn.sh" ]] && source "$HOME/.avn/bin/avn.sh" # load avn
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
[ `uname -s` != "Darwin" ] && return
```

### RethinkDB / Python

If you are receiving an error similar to the following when running `npm run db:copy`, you might be missing python drivers.  

Error
```
stderr: Error when launching 'rethinkdb-restore': No such file or directory
The rethinkdb-restore command depends on the RethinkDB Python driver, which must be installed.
If the Python driver is already installed, make sure that the PATH environment variable
includes the location of the backup scripts, and that the current user has permission to
access and run the scripts.
Instructions for installing the RethinkDB Python driver are available here:
http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/
```

Try installing python drivers with this command:  
`brew install python && sudo pip2 install rethinkdb`

### Unable to sign in via GitHub

If you've used the db:copy script to seed the database and still aren't logged in, there isn't an idm user in the test data linked to your github account. You'll need to manually insert an invite code to the database and use it to sign up in your local idm service.

Go to `localhost:8080` and use the `Data Explorer` to run the following command to issue yourself an invitation code.

```ReQl
r.db('idm_development').table('inviteCodes').insert({
  id: '0edb08e1-d8ab-4318-8363-0711a7f9edbb',
  code: 'hand_crafted_artisanal_invite_code',
  description: 'hand crafted artisanal invite code',
  roles: ['admin', 'learner'],
  active: true,
  createdAt: r.now(),
  updatedAt: r.now(),
})
```

Use the invitation code `hand_crafted_artisanal_invite_code` to create an account.

### Node version

When you change your working directory to the project directory of your IDM development environment, you may see a message with the format `avn could not activate node 6.11.1`. If so, install the required version (`nvm install 6.11.1`). That will also make that version the one that runs until you issue another `nvm use` command. `nvm ls` will show what versions of node are installed.

In the event that you see Javascript and C compilation errors when running `npm start`, ensure that your installed node version matches the node version in package.json:

```
➜ cat package.json | grep node\"
    "node": "5.6.x",
➜ node -v
v5.6.0
```

To run multiple versions of node on your machine, install `nvm` and then enter `use 5.6`.

### TypeErrors

If you see errors that look like

```
TypeError:
          method: GET /
          params: {}
          TypeError: An internal server error occurred
    at Strategy.OAuth2Strategy (/Users/jrob/workspace/learners-guild/idm/node_modules/passport-oauth2/lib/strategy.js:82:34)
    at new Strategy (/Users/jrob/workspace/learners-guild/idm/node_modules/passport-github/lib/strategy.js:62:18)
```
or

```
TypeError: OAuth2Strategy requires a clientID option
```

Ensure that your `NODE_ENV` is set:

`export NODE_ENV=development`

### NPM_AUTH_TOKEN Error Message

When attempting to `npm login`, if you see `Error: Failed to replace env in config: ${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}`, enter:

`export NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=""`
